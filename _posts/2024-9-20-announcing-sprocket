# Introducing Sprocket

We are excited to announce **Sprocket**, a validator and linter for the Workflow Description Language (WDL). Beyond just validation and linting, Sprocket is under active development towards becoming a workflow execution engine for bioinformatics and computational research. Sprocket uses WDL as it's workflow language of choice, making it a valuable addition to the growing ecosystem of WDL tools.


## What is Sprocket?


Sprocket is written in Rust. The code that drives Sprocket is split across the [`wdl`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl) family of crates, the [`sprocket`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket) command line tool, and the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stjude-rust-labs.sprocket-vscode).

Sprocket aims for the following:

- **WDL Compatibility**: Full support for workflows written in WDL, allowing users to define complex workflows in a readable and intuitive format.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for speed and minimal resource usage, Sprocket is a perfect fit for small-to-medium-sized computational projects.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Sprocket can run on local machines, clusters, and cloud environments, giving users the freedom to scale their workflows as needed.
- **Open-Source**: Developed under an open-source license, Sprocket encourages contributions from the community to extend its capabilities.

## Why Use Sprocket?

Sprocket aims at providing a minimal yet robust alternative for testing and running WDL workflows.

- **Simplicity**: For users who need to run WDL workflows quickly without complex infrastructure setup, Sprocket offers a straightforward solution.
- **Speed**: Sprocket is optimized to run workflows with low overhead, helping users execute their tasks faster and more efficiently.
- **Community-Driven**: As an open-source project, Sprocket is actively developed and improved by its community, making it adaptable to the needs of users in bioinformatics and beyond.

## VS Code Extension for Sprocket

To streamline the workflow development process, **Sprocket** provides a dedicated **Visual Studio Code extension**. This extension integrates Sprocket directly into the popular code editor, offering a powerful environment for writing, running, and debugging WDL workflows.

Here are some of the features the VS Code extension offers:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: The extension provides WDL syntax highlighting, making your code more readable and easier to navigate.
- **Auto-completion**: It supports auto-completion for WDL tasks, inputs, and outputs, helping you write WDL scripts faster and with fewer errors.
- **Integrated Workflow Execution**: You can execute Sprocket workflows directly within VS Code, eliminating the need to switch between the editor and the terminal.
- **Real-time Error Checking**: Catch issues in your WDL code as you write with integrated real-time error checking.
- **Output Logs**: View detailed execution logs within the VS Code interface, making debugging faster and more intuitive.

### Getting Started with the VS Code Extension

To begin using the Sprocket VS Code extension, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install the Extension**: Open Visual Studio Code, navigate to the Extensions tab, and search for "Sprocket." Install the extension from the marketplace.
2. **Configure Sprocket**: Set up the Sprocket executable path by going to your VS Code settings and pointing to the Sprocket installation on your machine.
3. **Run WDL Workflows**: Open a WDL file in VS Code, and you'll see the Sprocket toolbar to execute and monitor workflows directly from the editor.

For more detailed instructions, you can follow the official [Getting Started Guide for VS Code](https://stjude-rust-labs.github.io/sprocket/vscode/getting-started.html).
