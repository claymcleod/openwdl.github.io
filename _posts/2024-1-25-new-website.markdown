# OpenWDL Website Redesigned

We are excited to announce the fresh and improved look of the [OpenWDL website](https://www.openwdl.org)! The community has worked diligently to revamp the website, focusing on a clean design and minimizing any potential mistakes in the user experience.

## What's New?

### Sleek Design

The redesigned website comes with a sleek and modern design, providing a more intuitive and visually appealing experience for our users. The layout has been optimized to enhance navigation and make it easier for visitors to find the information they need.

### Improved Navigation

Finding your way around the OpenWDL website is now more straightforward than ever. The navigation has been improved to help users quickly locate documentation, resources, and other essential information.

## Why the Change?

The decision to redesign the website stemmed from our commitment to providing an exceptional user experience. We wanted to create a platform that not only showcases the power of Workflow Description Language (WDL) but also does so with clarity and precision.

By streamlining the design, we aim to make the OpenWDL website a go-to resource for individuals interested in WDL, whether they are newcomers or seasoned users.
